# ProofTag-UTXO-Based-BTC-Proof-of-Reserve-Protocol
ProofTag is a decentralized BTC Proof of Reserve (PoR) protocol based on UTXO tagging and verification. It allows institutions, DeFi projects, and exchanges to transparently verify BTC reserves without relying on centralized audits, enhancing trust and security in the Bitcoin ecosystem and exSat platform.
Currently, BTC reserves are not transparent, and users must trust exchanges, lending platforms, and custodians to hold assets honestly. Traditional Proof of Reserve mechanisms lack real-time verification and often depend on centralized audits, which are inefficient and prone to manipulation.

ProofTag addresses these issues by:
✅ Enabling on-chain, verifiable BTC Proof of Reserves using UTXO tagging.
✅ Providing a decentralized and cryptographic method to verify BTC holdings, eliminating the need for third-party audits.
✅ Integrating with the exSat ecosystem, ensuring Runes, Ordinals, and DeFi assets can transparently prove BTC backing.
✅ Supporting real-time reserve monitoring via UTXO indexers and Merkle proofs.
✅ Enhancing institutional credibility, allowing exchanges, DAOs, and protocols to publicly prove solvency.
